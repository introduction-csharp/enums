# Enumerated Types (and Extension Methods)

[Enumerated](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_enums.php) types are very useful for [discrete choices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/enum). 

Additionally, [extension methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/extension-methods) are neat syntactic sugar that look like member methods and can make your code more readable, [they can be used with enums](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15388072/how-to-add-extension-methods-to-enums), which is especially graceful, given enums cannot have methods defined directly. (They can [even be applied to interfaces](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2770333/can-extension-methods-be-applied-to-interfaces).)

**Reminder:** they need to be static methods in a static class, use the `this` keyword before the first parameter.  

## ToDo

There are some [tasks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XYuPv5Lo-YiKKruYRYq0gZ_V8Y-pNCpeh3ceq2yPqes/edit?usp=sharing) to do.
